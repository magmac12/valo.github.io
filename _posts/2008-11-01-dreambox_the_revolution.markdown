I haven't written anything about the company I am working right now. May be one of the reasons is that my free time is highly limited (I guess working in a start-up is aways like that ;-)).

Well, the company is [dreambox.com](http://www.dreambox.com) and our main goal is to revolutionize the way the on-line learning is functioning. The idea is to provide personalized on-line learning. Right now we are focused on building on-line learning platform, which is targeted at teaching math to small children. Expect more interesting information to come.

I also have posts in the company blog. Right now it is only one with the idea of increasing. Check it out [here](http://www.dreambox.com/blog/pushing-the-kids-from-very-early-age-why-dont-we-just-let-them-have-fun/221/).
