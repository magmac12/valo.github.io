This is my personal blog, which is powered by several new and exiting technologies for me. Heroku, Sinatra, HAML and RDiscount (markdown).

I decided to call this engine blogxter. It relies purely on the filesystem, which makes blogging very easy task. I just fire up a Textmate and create a new file. The posts are written in markdown. I decided to use it because it is very understandable. In the future I am thinking about trying with AsciiDoc.

The site is hosted on [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com) and runs with sinatra. I use HAML for defining the layout and soon I will switch to Sass, when the styles start to get complex.

This is for now. I will soon post the code of the engine on github. Stay connected.
