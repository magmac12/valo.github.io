On the 27th of July there will be a small rails conference in Sofia. http://techcamp.eu/2009/06/21/rails-конференция-27-06-2009/ has more info for the event.

I will be speaking on the conference about stubbing and mocking with mocha. I have made an example project on which I will explain my ideas. You can find the latest source [here](http://github.com/valo/mochar/tree/master).

We will see there :-).
