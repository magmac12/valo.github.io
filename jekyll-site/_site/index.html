	  				<p>I few days ago I attended the <a href="https://2016.fullstackfest.com/">Full Stack Fest</a> in Barcelona. It was a great conference and I really enjoyed the way it was organized and the talks that I watched. Great thanks to the organizers <a href="http://www.codegram.com/">codegram</a> and to <a href="https://www.airhelp.com/en/">AirHelp</a> for sponsoring my attendance. I tried to keep notes during the conference about interesting ideas and projects, so this blog post is a recap of what I learned from the conference.</p>

	  				<p>Developing apps as a set of microservices is getting more and more popular in the recent years. Usually teams decide to adopt this approach as a way to decrease the complexity of their projects. I won’t go into details if this approach is good or bad, but I’m convinced that it has its place in the arsenal of software practices a good engineer should have.</p>

	  				<p>In the last blog post I showed you how to <a href="http://www.valentinmihov.com/2015/04/17/adult-income-data-set/">slice and dice a data
set</a> describing
individual people and trying to predict if they make more than $50,000 annually.
We used <a href="http://ipython.org/">ipython</a> and a bunch of libraries to do the
analysis, build a prediction model and evaluate its performance. This requires
having knowledge about how to use all these python libraries and what exactly to
do with the data (although you can use the ipython notebook from that blog post
as a general framework to analyze any data set). It also requires installing all
this software on your system, which can be non-trivial.</p>

income data for about 32000 people. We will look at the data and build a machine

year, given data like education, gender and martial status.</p>

  				<p>
	  				<p>Some may argue that the view specs in your rails project are just duplicating the feature specs you have. The idea of the view specs is to test the views in isolation, while the feature specs test user stories end-to-end, usually using tools like capybara and phantomjs (if you want to test JS functionality).</p>

	  				<p>Recently I got into a situation at work, where there was a Rails app, which was exposing some data through an API which uses <a href="https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers">active_record_serializers</a> and <a href="http://emberjs.com/">EmberJS</a> as front-end of the data. The problem was there needed to be a new Rails app, which also consumes data from the same Rails API endpoints and visualize the data. Unfortunatelly <a href="https://github.com/rails/activeresource">ActiveResource</a> and <a href="https://github.com/remiprev/her">Her</a> are not supporting the ember-data kind of data format, which requires to have separate serializers for EmberJS and for regular Rails API calls. So the <a href="https://github.com/valo/ember_data_active_model_parser">ember_data_active_model_parser</a> was born, which is a middleware for Her, which makes it understand the ember-data JSON format.</p>

	  				<p>I decided to make a self made home automation system in my apartment. The reason is that I figured out that turning on and off my heating when I am not around reduces my electricity bill by 50%. My current schedule is to turn off the heating when I leave the house and turn it on 1 hour before I come back home. I do the same thing with the heating in my bedroom. The heating there is turned on about an hour before I go to sleep and I turn it off during the day. However there are exceptions from these rules especailly around holidays, so an automation system should also be very configurable.</p>

	  				<p>If you have tried to develop some rails application on Rails + Ruby 1.9.1 and MySQL database and you are storing non-English characters in your database probably you had a lot of pain with errors about incompatible charsets. This is a known problem and there is even <a href="https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/2476-ascii-8bit-encoding-of-query-results-in-rails-232-and-ruby-191">a bug in Rails’ lighthouse</a> for it. There is even a hack which is going around the issue. The solution is not perfect, but it works in most of the cases.</p>
