When I was still in high school I wrote a game. It was a cloning of the famous Arcanoid game and was written in [Allegro](http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/allegro/). The unique feature of the game is that it supports multiplayer on one PC, which is something like deathmatch. Today I found the source and opened a project in Google Code. Here is it: [http://code.google.com/p/breakin/](http://code.google.com/p/breakin/) (the project is called breakin, because breakit is used for another project in sourceforge).
